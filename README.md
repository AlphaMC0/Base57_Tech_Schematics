+ **Weapons**
  - The Energy Sword (_Tizona_) :
      - The sword has two mithril absorbers
      - The sword contains 1d per absorber
      - The sword's hilt is made out of Orthrim and anti
      - The chambers with mithril are lined with Rethrim
      - The sword has 4 modes for the energy blade :
           Mode 1 Safe mode : When 80% of the first mithril absorbers power is used it will switch to the second one and when 80% of that power is used it will switch of the sword completly and will only turn on when the mithril is done 
        fully regaining all of its power.
           Mode 2 Semi Safe mode: When 99% of the first mithril absorbers power is used it will switch to the second one and when 99% of that power is used it will switch of the sword completly and will only turn on when the mithril is 
        done fully regaining all of its power.
          Mode 3 Nuclear : It forces the sword to turn on even if the mithril in the sword hasn't completly regained all of its power. (Be warned it could yeild distructive results)
          Mode 4 Overload : Used for distroying the sword and mithril within it it will overload the mithril with power it it goes nuclear.(Warning after activation you have 5 seconds to escape or you will DIE)
      - The sword's blade is made of pure energy
      - The sword can also change the effect gravity has on it
           Mode 1 No gravity can affect the sword
           Mode 2 Normal gravity will affect the sword
           Mode 3 Custom the player can set a custom amount that gravity can affect the sword.
      - The sword can operate for 10 hours while using 80% of both mithril alsorbers
      - The sword can be distroyed with another energy sword

  - **Required materials** :
      - 8 magnets
      - Rethrim slider parts
      - Rethrim top slider parts
      - 10 Anti core inserts
      - Orthrim top core
      - Rethrim upper chamber
      - Rethrim lower chamber
      - 2 Rethrim upper teeth
      - 2 Rethrim lower teeth
      - 3 Rethrim spines
      - 2 500g mithril gems
      - 4 Nth Disks
      - Rethrim lower chamber
      - Orthrim lower core
      - 2 Copper B4 rods
      - 2 Rethrim chamber tubes
  - **Production of the required parts** :
      - Magnets: 1 magnet requires 1/2t of atractium then melt it and pour them into molds (Make sure the molds are electrified). Take them out of the molds and sand till smooth.
      - Rethrim slider parts: I have made parts for them , they are located in the storage bay. Melt the rethrim then pour into the molds then take them out to sand til smooth and apply coat of black paint.
      - Anti core inserts: Molds are located in the storage bay. Pour melted anti into mold then take out to sand till smooth.
      - Orthrim top core: Molds are located in the storage bay. Pour melted Orthrim into the molds then take out for sanding.
      - Rethrim upper and lower chambers: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Pour melted rethrim into mold then take out for sanding.
      - Rethrim upper and lower teeth: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Pour melted rethrim into molds then take out for sanding.
      - Rethrim spines: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Pour melted rethrim into molds then take out for sanding.
      - Nth Disks: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Melt Nth with mithril energy tool. Pour melted nth into mold then take it out to wash with distiled water.
      - Rethrim lower core: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Pour melted rethrim into the mold then take out to sand.
      - Orthrim lower core: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Pour melted rethrim into the mold then take out to sand. Add programmed motherboard to control the sword (It has to be circular) add sensors over the motherboard.
      - Copper B4 rods: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Pour melted rethrim into the mold then take out to sand.
      - Rethrim chamber tubes: Molds can be found in the storage bay. Pour melted rethrim into the molds then take out for sanding.
      - Mithril: Purify the two mithril gems.(Requires builder to know the mithril purification process).
